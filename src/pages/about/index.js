          Hello, I'm Tyler. I design and build things on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like working where data, design and engineering come together, building intuitive, accessible, and engaging experiences. Iâ€™ve worked in various roles in digital media for more than a decade, and I collaborate best with small, interdisciplinary teams that punch above their weight. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Boston, with my partner and my cat.
        </p>
        <p>You can reach me at tyler.machado@gmail.com.</p>
