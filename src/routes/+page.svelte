  <p class="text-2xl font-bold">Hi, I'm Tyler.</p>

  <p>I make websites, dashboards, data visualizations, and design systems.</p>

  <p>I’ve been a web developer and design technologist for more than a decade, pulling from my technical experience, design mindset, and journalism training. Whether I’m building behind-the-scenes tools or platform enhancements for journalists, or producing my own creative interactive content for readers, I'm here to help independent media brands thrive on the modern web.</p>

  <p>I’m currently working on freelance projects, and I have capacity for more contract work or fractional roles for spring/summer 2025. <a href="/contact">Want to work together?</a></p>
