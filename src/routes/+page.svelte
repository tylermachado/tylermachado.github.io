  <p>I make websites, dashboards, data visualizations, and design systems.</p>

  <p>I approach my work with a mix of technical experience, design mindset, and journalistic training. I’ve been building creative, engaging, accessible digital experiences for more than a decade, having collaborated with both enterprise-scale international media websites and tiny startup nonprofits. These days I'm particularly interested in working with ambitious small teams and mission-driven organizations.</p>

  <p>My toolkit these days includes (but is not limited to): Svelte, React, D3.js, Python, WordPress block themes.</p>

  <p>When I’m not at my desk, you’ll most likely find me at the restaurants, rock clubs, and soccer fields of New England. I live in Boston with my partner, my cat, and entirely too many records.</p>

  <p>I’m currently working on freelance projects, and I'm looking to book more freelance work or fractional roles through spring and summer of 2025. </p>
